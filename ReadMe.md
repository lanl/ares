ARES : Abstract Representation for the Extreme-Scale Stack
==========================================================

Project ARES represents a joint effort between [LANL](https://www.lanl.gov/) and
[ORNL](https://www.lanl.gov/) to introduce a common compiler representation and
tool-chain for HPC applications. At the project's core is the *High Level
Intermediate Representation*, or HLIR, for common compiler toolchains. HLIR is
built ontop of the LLVM IR, using metadata to represent high-level parallel
constructs.

##### Out-of-source builds are preferred when compiling ARES, e.g: #####

    $ cd ares
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make
